## describtion
This script is designed to automatically initiate a votekick against players who are not friends or party members and are on the same team as the local player in a casual game mode.

The script creates a menu that allows the user to enable or disable the votekick feature. When the feature is enabled, the script will periodically check for teammates who are not friends or party members and initiate a votekick against them.

The script also checks if the target player is a party member and skips the votekick if they are.

The script uses the MenuLib library to create the menu and the callbacks library to register and unregister callbacks for when the script is loaded and unloaded.

Overall, this script is designed to help automatically initiating votekicks against teammates.
